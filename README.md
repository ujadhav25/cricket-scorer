## Data Models

- **User** — Organizer or Player role, linked Google/email account
- **Player** — Cricket profile with batting/bowling style and career stats
- **Team** — Roster with captain, colors, and join token
- **Match** — Two teams, innings, ball-by-ball deliveries, MOTM
- **Tournament** — League / Knockout / Group Stage / Bilateral with standings
- **Innings / Over / Delivery** — Full ball-by-ball scoring data

---

## Authentication

- Google OAuth (one-click sign-in)
- Email magic link (optional — set `EMAIL_SERVER` env var)
- A `Player` record is automatically created for every new account

---

## Deployment

The app is deployed on **Vercel**. Set all environment variables in **Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables**.

For Sentry source map uploads to work in CI, the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` must have the `project:releases` and `org:read` scopes.

```bash
# Production build (source maps uploaded to Sentry automatically)
npm run build
```

---

## Rate Limiting

In-memory sliding-window rate limiter applied in middleware:

| Route group | Limit |
|---|---|
| Auth (`/api/auth/signin`) | 10 req / min |
| Join links | 20 req / min |
| General API | 120 req / min |
| Scoring API | 240 req / min |

> For multi-region deployments, swap the in-memory store for [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com).
